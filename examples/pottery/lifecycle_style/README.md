This is an example of a custom structure that defines [Pottery-style lifecycle functions](../../../docs/lifecycle_style.md).

The example defines an `employee_t` representing an employee at a company. It uses several string types in order to demonstrate how you might manage the lifecycles of a variety of sub-objects with Pottery-style lifecycle functions.

The example then defines a hash map, passing along all eight lifecycle functions to enable all lifecycle functionality of the container.

See the [Pottery Lifecycle Style documentation](../../../docs/lifecycle_style.md) for a walkthrough of the employee code.
