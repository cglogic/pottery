/*
 * Wraps Pottery's heap_sort in a C++ template.
 *
 * Use pottery::heap_sort() as a mostly drop-in replacement for std::sort()
 * with a few caveats:
 *
 * - Heap sort has safe worst case behaviour and relatively small code size but
 *   is generally much slower than algorithms like quick sort or intro sort.
 *   Your std::sort() is probably much faster with the same worst case time.
 *
 * - Throwing move and throwing swap are not supported. If a move constructor
 *   or swap throws, the program aborts. It is strongly recommended that your
 *   move constructor be marked noexcept.
